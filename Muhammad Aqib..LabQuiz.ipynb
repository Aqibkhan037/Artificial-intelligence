              "summary": "{\n  \"name\": \"df\",\n  \"rows\": 2225,\n  \"fields\": [\n    {\n      \"column\": \"news\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2127,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Millions go missing at China bank\\n \\n Two senior officials at one of China's top commercial banks have reportedly disappeared after funds worth up to $120m (\\u00c2\\u00a364m) went missing.\\n \\n The pair both worked at Bank of China in the northern city of Harbin, the South China Morning Post reported. The latest scandal at Bank of China will do nothing to reassure foreign investors that China's big four banks are ready for international listings. Government policy sees the bank listings as vital economic reforms. Bank of China is one of two frontrunners in the race to list overseas. The other is China Construction Bank. Both are expected to list abroad during 2005.\\n \\n They shared a $45bn state bailout in 2003, to help clean up their balance sheets in preparation for a foreign stock market debut.\\n \\n However, a report in the China-published Economic Observer said on Monday that the two banks may have scrapped plans to list in New York because of the cost of meeting regulatory requirements imposed since the Enron scandal. Bank of China is the country's biggest foreign exchange dealer, while China Construction Bank is the largest deposit holder. China's banking sector is burdened with at least $190bn of bad debt according to official data, though most observers believe the true figure is far higher. Officially, one in five loans is not being repaid. Attempts to strengthen internal controls and tighten lending policies have uncovered a succession of scandals involving embezzlement by bank officials and loans-for-favours. The most high-profile case involved the ex-president of Bank of China, Wang Xuebing, jailed for 12 years in 2003. Although, he committed the offences whilst running Bank of China in New York, Mr Wang was head of China Construction Bank when the scandal broke. Earlier this month, a China Construction Bank branch manager was jailed for life in a separate case.\\n \\n China's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness. The introduction of market reforms has been accompanied by attempts to modernise the banking sector, but links between banks and local government remain strong. Last year, China's premier, Wen Jiabao, targeted bank lending practices in a series of speeches, and regulators ordered all big loans to be scrutinised, in an attempt to cool down irresponsible lending. China's leaders see reforming the top four banks as vital to distribute capital to profitable companies and protect the health of China's economic boom. But two problems persist. First, inefficient state enterprises continue to receive protection from bankruptcy because they employ large numbers of people. Second, many questionable loans come not from the big four, but from smaller banks. Another high profile financial firm, China Life, is facing shareholder lawsuits and a probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission following its 2004 New York listing over its failure to disclose accounting irregularities at its parent company.\\n\",\n          \"Portable PlayStation ready to go\\n \\n Sony's PlayStation Portable (PSP) will go on sale in Japan on 12 December.\\n \\n The long-awaited handheld game playing gadget will cost about 19,800 yen (145 euros) when it hits the shelves. At launch 21 games will be available for the PSP, including Need for Speed, Ridge Racer, Metal Gear Acid and Vampire Chronicle. Sony has not yet announced when the PSP will be available in Europe and the US, but analysts expect it to debut in those territories in early 2005.\\n \\n Fifa 2005 is back at the top of the UK games charts, a week after losing it to rival Pro Evolution Soccer 4. Konami's Pro Evo dropped only one place to two, while the only new entry in the top 10 was another football title, LMA Manager 2005, in at number seven. Tony Hawk's Underground 2 held its own at three, while Star Wars Battlefront inched up to four places to four. There was good news for Disney, with the spin-off from the Shark's Tale film moving up the charts into number eight.\\n \\n Fans of the Gran Turismo series in Europe are going to have to wait until next year for the latest version. Sony has said that the PAL version of GT4 will not be ready for Christmas. \\\"The product is localised into 13 different languages across the PAL territories, therefore the process takes considerably longer than it does in Japan,\\\" it said. Gran Turismo 4 for the PlayStation 2 is still expected to be released in Japan and the USA this year.\\n \\n Halo 2 has broken video game records, with pre-orders of more than 1.5 million in the US alone. Some 6,500 US stores plan to open just after midnight on Tuesday 9 November for the game's release. \\\"Halo 2 is projected to bring in more revenue than any day one box office blockbuster movie in the United States,\\\" said Xbox's Peter Moore. \\\"We've even heard rumours of fan anticipation of the 'Halo 2 flu' on 9 November.\\\"\\n\",\n          \"Tomlinson stays focused on Europe\\n \\n Long jumper Chris Tomlinson has cut his schedule to ensure he is fully fit for the European Indoor Championships.\\n \\n The 23-year-old has a minor injury and has pulled out of international meets in Madrid and Lievin this week as well as warm-weather training in Lanzarote. \\\"It's nothing serious,\\\" said his coach Peter Stanley. \\\"He strained a muscle in his abdomen at the Birmingham meeting but is back in full training.\\\" Sprinter Mark Lewis-Francis will also not compete in Madrid on Thursday. The Birmingham athlete, who clocked a season's best of 6.61 seconds over 60m in Birmingham last week, also prefers to focus his attentions on next month's European Indoor Championships.\\n \\n Lewis-Francis, who was runner-up to British team-mate Jason Gardener at the Europeans three years ago, will continue his training at home. Meanwhile, Tomlinson is still searching for this first major medal and this season he has shown he could be in the sort of form to grab a spot on the podium in Madrid. The Middlesbrough athlete jumped a season's best of 7.95m at the Birmingham Grand Prix - good enough to push world indoor champion Savante Stringfellow into second.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"entertainment\",\n          \"tech\",\n          \"politics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

valuing the premiership club at \\u00e2\\u00a3800m\\n \\n the us tycoon who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months has approached the united board with detailed proposals it has confirmed mr glazer who owns the tampa bay buccaneers team hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted his new offer is expected to contain substantially less debt mr glazer has already had one takeover attempt turned down by the red devils and responded by using his 281 shareholding to vote off three board members last november\\n \\n man united had turned down the bid because it was based on a high level of borrowing but newspapers have speculated recently that the tycoon had gained the support of leading banks to come up with a stronger and less debtladen bid last week however mr glazer issued a statement to the stock exchange distancing himself from a new bid\\n \\n meanwhile uniteds chief executive david gill said in december that talks would not resume unless glazer came up with definitive proposals now the board has confirmed that the us bidder is back with a statement issued on sunday reading the board can confirm it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various preconditions which may form the basis of an offer a further announcement will be made in due course\\n \\n to succeed malcolm glazer will still need the approval of major shareholders john magnier and jp mcmanus who own 289 of the club but the irish duo have cut off talks with glazer over the proposed sale of their stake and have so far made no comment on his latest approach united fans have reacted with anger at the announcement they have vehemently opposed any proposed takeover by glazer since he first showed interest in the club in september 2003 and after sundays announcement they vowed to fight on we will fight tooth and nail to stop him whatever his offer says we do not want him or anybody else taking over united said mark longden of the independent manchester united supporters association the campaign against this proposed takeover will continue as it has done since glazer first showed interest in the club\\n\",\n          \"souness eyes summer move for owen\\n \\n newcastle boss graeme souness is lining up a summer move for england and real madrid striker michael owen\\n \\n he sees owen as the ideal replacement for alan shearer who is due to retire in the summer although he hopes to persuade shearer to carry on michael is in the category of players who would excite the fans and were monitoring him he told bbc newcastle he is a great centreforward and only 25 but i dont think were the only ones monitoring the situation at real souness has also hinted he thinks shearer may carry on despite his stated intent to retire at the end of the season he believes the prospect of breaking jackie milburns club scoring record may influence the strikers decision\\n \\n milburn scored 200 league and cup goals between 1946 and 1957 while shearer currently has 187 goals to his name without giving too much away i am confident he will be here next season said souness i cant imagine him leaving without breaking jackie milburns scoring record souness also revealed he tried to bring back nolberto solano during the january transfer window the peruvian international was sold to aston villa a year ago but in the phonein for bbc newcastle souness said tried to resign him but villa were not interested in selling\\n \\n the former rangers and liverpool boss is also looking to bring in a number of new acquisitions once the current campaign has been completed im after three four or five new players in the summer  we have got lots of targets he said dont think we will wait to the last day of the season to say who are we going to target now\\n\",\n          \"china net cafe culture crackdown\\n \\n chinese authorities closed 12575 net cafes in the closing months of 2004 the countrys government said\\n \\n according to the official news agency most of the net cafes were closed down because they were operating illegally chinese net cafes operate under a set of strict guidelines and many of those most recently closed broke rules that limit how close they can be to schools the move is the latest in a series of steps the chinese government has taken to crack down on what it considers to be immoral net use\\n \\n the official xinhua news agency said the crackdown was carried out to create a safer environment for young people in china rules introduced in 2002 demand that net cafes be at least 200 metres away from middle and elementary schools the hours that children can use net cafes are also tightly regulated china has long been worried that net cafes are an unhealthy influence on young people the 12575 cafes were shut in the three months from october to december china also tries to dictate the types of computer games people can play to limit the amount of violence people are exposed to\\n \\n net cafes are hugely popular in china because the relatively high cost of computer hardware means that few people have pcs in their homes this is not the first time that the chinese government has moved against net cafes that are not operating within its strict guidelines all the 100000 or so net cafes in the country are required to use software that controls what websites users can see logs of sites people visit are also kept laws on net cafe opening hours and who can use them were introduced in 2002 following a fire at one cafe that killed 25 people during the crackdown following the blaze authorities moved to clean up net cafes and demanded that all of them get permits to operate in august 2004 chinese authorities shut down 700 websites and arrested 224 people in a crackdown on net porn at the same time it introduced new controls to block overseas sex sites the reporters without borders group said in a report that chinese government technologies for email interception and net censorship are among the most highly developed in the world\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n
